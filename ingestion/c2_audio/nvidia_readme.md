| [![Model size](https://img.shields.io/badge/Params-600M-lightgrey#model-badge)](#model-architecture)
<!-- | [![Language](https://img.shields.io/badge/Language-multilingual-lightgrey#model-badge)](#datasets) -->

This model is a streaming multitalker ASR model based on the Parakeet architecture. The model only takes the speaker diarization outputs as external information and eliminates the need for explicit speaker queries or enrollment audio [[Wang et al., 2025]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22646). Unlike conventional target-speaker ASR approaches that require speaker embeddings, this model dynamically adapts to individual speakers through speaker-wise speech activity prediction.

The key innovation involves injecting learnable **speaker kernels** into the pre-encode layer of the Fast-Conformer encoder. These speaker kernels are generated via speaker supervision activations, enabling instantaneous adaptation to target speakers. This approach leverages the inherent tendency of streaming ASR systems to prioritize specific speakers, repurposing this mechanism to achieve robust speaker-focused recognition.

The model architecture requires deploying **one model instance per speaker**, meaning the number of model instances matches the number of speakers in the conversation. While this necessitates additional computational resources, it achieves state-of-the-art performance in handling fully overlapped speech in both offline and streaming scenarios.

## Key Advantages

This self-speaker adaptation approach offers several advantages over traditional multitalker ASR methods:

1. **No Speaker Enrollment**: Unlike target-speaker ASR systems that require pre-enrollment audio or speaker embeddings, this model only needs speaker activity information from diarization
2. **Handles Severe Overlap**: Each instance focuses on a single speaker, enabling accurate transcription even during fully overlapped speech
3. **Streaming Capable**: Designed for real-time streaming scenarios with configurable latency-accuracy tradeoffs
4. **Leverages Single-Speaker Models**: Can be fine-tuned from strong pre-trained single-speaker ASR models, and single speaker ASR performance is also preserved

## Model Architecture

### Speaker Kernel Injection

The streaming multitalker Parakeet model employs a **speaker kernel injection** mechanism at some layers of the Fast-Conformer encoder. As shown in the figure below, learnable speaker kernels are injected into selected encoder layers, enabling the model to dynamically adapt to specific speakers.

<div align="center">
    <img src="figures/speaker_injection.png" width="750" />
</div>
The speaker kernels are generated through speaker supervision activations that detect speech activity for each target speaker. This enables the encoder states to become more responsive to the targeted speaker's speech characteristics, even during periods of fully overlapped speech.

### Multi-Instance Architecture

The model is based on the Parakeet architecture and consists of a [NeMo Encoder for Speech Tasks (NEST)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13106)[4] which is based on [Fast-Conformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05084)[5] encoder. The key architectural innovation is the **multi-instance approach**, where one model instance is deployed per speaker as illustrated below:

<div align="center">
    <img src="figures/multi_instance.png" width="1400" />
</div>
Each model instance:
- Receives the same mixed audio input
- Injects speaker-specific kernels at the pre-encode layer
- Produces transcription output specific to its target speaker
- Operates independently and can run in parallel with other instances

This architecture enables the model to handle severe speech overlap by having each instance focus exclusively on one speaker, eliminating the permutation problem that affects other multitalker ASR approaches.

## NVIDIA NeMo

To train, fine-tune or perform multitalker ASR with this model, you will need to install [NVIDIA NeMo](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo)[7]. We recommend you install it after you've installed Cython and latest PyTorch version.

```bash
apt-get update && apt-get install -y libsndfile1 ffmpeg
pip install Cython packaging
pip install git+https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo.git@main#egg=nemo_toolkit[asr]
```

## How to Use this Model

The model is available for use in the NeMo Framework[7], and can be used as a pre-trained checkpoint for inference or for fine-tuning on another dataset.

**Important**: This model uses a multi-instance architecture where you need to deploy one model instance per speaker. Each instance receives the same audio input along with speaker-specific diarization information to perform self-speaker adaptation.

### Method 1. Code snippet 

 Load one of the NeMo speaker diarization models:  
 [Streaming Sortformer Diarizer v2](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/diar_streaming_sortformer_4spk-v2.1),  
 [Streaming Sortformer Diarizer v2.1](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/diar_streaming_sortformer_4spk-v2.1)   
```python
from nemo.collections.asr.models import SortformerEncLabelModel, ASRModel
import torch
# A speaker diarization model is needed for tracking the speech activity of each speaker.
diar_model = SortformerEncLabelModel.from_pretrained("nvidia/diar_streaming_sortformer_4spk-v2.1").eval().to(torch.device("cuda"))
asr_model = ASRModel.from_pretrained("nvidia/multitalker-parakeet-streaming-0.6b-v1").eval().to(torch.device("cuda"))
# Use the pre-defined dataclass template `MultitalkerTranscriptionConfig` from `multitalker_transcript_config.py`. 
# Configure the diarization model using streaming parameters:
from multitalker_transcript_config import MultitalkerTranscriptionConfig
from omegaconf import OmegaConf
cfg = OmegaConf.structured(MultitalkerTranscriptionConfig())
cfg.audio_file = "/path/to/your/audio.wav"
cfg.output_path = "/path/to/output_transcription.json"
diar_model = MultitalkerTranscriptionConfig.init_diar_model(cfg, diar_model)
# Load your audio file into a streaming audio buffer to simulate a real-time audio session.
from nemo.collections.asr.parts.utils.streaming_utils import CacheAwareStreamingAudioBuffer
samples = [{'audio_filepath': cfg.audio_file}]
streaming_buffer = CacheAwareStreamingAudioBuffer(
    model=asr_model,
    online_normalization=cfg.online_normalization,
    pad_and_drop_preencoded=cfg.pad_and_drop_preencoded,
)
streaming_buffer.append_audio_file(audio_filepath=cfg.audio_file, stream_id=-1)
streaming_buffer_iter = iter(streaming_buffer)
# Use the helper class `SpeakerTaggedASR`, which handles all ASR and diarization cache data for streaming.
from nemo.collections.asr.parts.utils.multispk_transcribe_utils import SpeakerTaggedASR
multispk_asr_streamer = SpeakerTaggedASR(cfg, asr_model, diar_model)
for step_num, (chunk_audio, chunk_lengths) in enumerate(streaming_buffer_iter):
    drop_extra_pre_encoded = (
        0
        if step_num == 0 and not cfg.pad_and_drop_preencoded
        else asr_model.encoder.streaming_cfg.drop_extra_pre_encoded
    )
    with torch.inference_mode():
        with torch.amp.autocast(diar_model.device.type, enabled=True):
            with torch.no_grad():
                multispk_asr_streamer.perform_parallel_streaming_stt_spk(
                    step_num=step_num,
                    chunk_audio=chunk_audio,
                    chunk_lengths=chunk_lengths,
                    is_buffer_empty=streaming_buffer.is_buffer_empty(),
                    drop_extra_pre_encoded=drop_extra_pre_encoded,
                )
                print(multispk_asr_streamer.instance_manager.batch_asr_states[0].seglsts)
# Generate the speaker-tagged transcript and print it.
multispk_asr_streamer.generate_seglst_dicts_from_parallel_streaming(samples=samples)
print(multispk_asr_streamer.instance_manager.seglst_dict_list)
```

### Method 2. Use NeMo example file in NVIDIA/NeMo

Use [the multitalker streaming ASR example script file](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/NeMo/blob/main/examples/asr/asr_cache_aware_streaming/speech_to_text_multitalker_streaming_infer.py) in [NVIDIA NeMo Framework](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/NeMo) to launch. With this method, download the `.nemo` model files and specify that in the script:
```bash
python ${NEMO_ROOT}/examples/asr/asr_cache_aware_streaming/speech_to_text_multitalker_streaming_infer.py \
          asr_model="/path/to/your/multitalker-parakeet-streaming-0.6b-v1.nemo" \
          diar_model="/path/to/your/nvidia/diar_streaming_sortformer_4spk-v2.nemo" \
          att_context_size="[70,13]" \
          generate_realtime_scripts=False \
          audio_file="/path/to/example.wav" \
          output_path="/path/to/example_output.json" 
```

Or the `audio_file` argument can be replaced with the `manifest_file` to handle multiple files in batch mode:
```bash
python ${NEMO_ROOT}/examples/asr/asr_cache_aware_streaming/speech_to_text_multitalker_streaming_infer.py \
          ... \
          manifest_file="example.json" \
          ... \
```

In `example.json` file, each line is a dictionary containing the following fields:
```python
{
    "audio_filepath": "/path/to/multispeaker_audio1.wav",  # path to the input audio file 
    "offset": 0, # offset (start) time of the input audio
    "duration": 600,  # duration of the audio, can be set to `null` if using NeMo main branch
}
{
    "audio_filepath": "/path/to/multispeaker_audio2.wav",  
    "offset": 900,
    "duration": 580,  
}
```

### Setting up Streaming Configuration

Latency is defined by the `att_context_size`, all measured in **80ms frames**:
* [70, 0]: Chunk size = 1 (1 * 80ms = 0.08s)
* [70, 1]: Chunk size = 2 (2 * 80ms = 0.16s)
* [70, 6]: Chunk size = 7 (7 * 80ms = 0.56s)
* [70, 13]: Chunk size = 14 (14 * 80ms = 1.12s)

### Input

This model accepts single-channel (mono) audio sampled at 16,000 Hz.
